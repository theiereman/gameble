# gameble

A Rails 8.1 application: four domain packs under `packs/` (`catalog`, `steam`, `accounts`, `game`) and a thin web layer in `app/`. Assets are served by Vite.

## Requirements

- Ruby and Node at the versions of `.tool-versions` (`asdf plugin update ruby`, then `asdf install`; an older asdf Ruby plugin does not know Ruby 4.0.7)
- Docker, for the local PostgreSQL 18

## Setup

```sh
docker compose up -d          # PostgreSQL on localhost:5433
bin/setup --skip-server       # gems, npm packages, databases
```

The database connection reads `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD`, with defaults matching `compose.yaml`.

## Run

```sh
bin/dev                       # Rails on http://localhost:3000 and the Vite dev server
```

Set `PORT` to use another port for Rails.

## Writing an operation

Every state change is an operation (AD-3). Inherit `ApplicationOperation`, name it `Pack::VerbNoun`, and wrap its writes and its `publish(event, stream_name:)` call in `transaction do ... end`, so the rows and the event (identifiers only) commit or roll back together. Call another operation of the pack only through `step`: the inner `transaction` joins the outer one, so an inner `Failure` handled without `step` would keep the inner rows and event, while `step` halts the outer flow and rolls back the whole transaction. Return `Success(value)`, or `Failure(:code)` with a message under the locale key `errors.<pack>.<code>` (`Game::OpenPack.failure_message(:no_pack)` reads `errors.game.no_pack`). `test/lib/application_operation_test.rb` shows a complete example.

## Test

```sh
bin/rails test
bin/rails zeitwerk:check
```
