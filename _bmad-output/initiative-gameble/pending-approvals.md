# Pending approvals

Operations and decisions waiting for the author's go-ahead, kept since 2026-10-02. Open items first; settled ones are listed by date at the end.

- **Cloudflare and link previews (epic 4).** When Cloudflare is set up: Bot Fight Mode off, or a WAF skip rule for Discordbot, Twitterbot and WhatsApp on `/*/cards/*` (the share link since story 4.7) and `/*/brothers/*` (public profiles, and the old share links that redirect to the card), or previews fail.
- **Manual preview check (story 4.5).** Paste a share link in Discord, X and WhatsApp once a public HTTPS host exists (the LXC's LAN address cannot be reached by their servers).
- **`PUBLIC_URL` for the public host (story 4.5; staging set to https://gameble.dotsncircles.com on 2026-10-06).** Share links, `og:url` and the canonical link are built on `PUBLIC_URL`, never on the request's Host header; `config/deploy.yml` sets it to `http://192.168.1.6` for the test LXC. Once a public HTTPS host exists, set `PUBLIC_URL` to it (`https://…`, no path) and redeploy, or shared links keep pointing at the LAN address. Since story 4.7, production refuses to boot when `PUBLIC_URL` is missing or malformed (`PublicUrl::Invalid`, checked by `config/initializers/public_url.rb`; the Docker build's `assets:precompile` is exempt), and `test/config/public_url_test.rb` fails if `config/deploy.yml` stops setting a valid one. A deploy with a bad value fails its health check instead of serving 500s.

## After the UX redesign merge (2026-10-05)


## Settled on 2026-10-03

- GitHub issues #1–#11 of epic 1 closed.
- Daily bonus booster odds confirmed (spec CAP-16).
- AD-7 amended: replacement packs drawn inline by `Game::TopUpBank`.
- Public profile title: the Steam persona name, stored at each sign-in, with "Brother <code>" as fallback (story 4.4 plan updated).
- Share previews carry no image at all, not even a card back, even if X shows a bare link (spec CAP-9; built in story 4.5).
- Epics 3 and 4 breakdowns: judged through their retrospectives instead.
- The import drops the store API (story 2.10); a degraded local import of 1,000 games was run in development.
- Shared links show the card only (spec CAP-9, story 4.7); epic 4's R5 and Done when 3 reconciled.

## Settled on 2026-10-05

- Superseded by the UX redesign (`DESIGN.md`, `EXPERIENCE.md`, final 2026-10-05), to apply when the reveal is rebuilt: the large card back size, tier cues on a dusty back (dust, rarity seal and wipe are dropped; one click reveals rarity and game together), the reveal's phone layout (phone pile with a tray; breakpoints 720 and 1180 px) and flip all on a phone ("Tout révéler").
- `main` pushed with the UX redesign merge, and the remote `ux-redesign` branch deleted.
- Ownership notice: no notice or copyright on the card; the legal page says, in substance, « Toutes les illustrations appartiennent aux éditeurs des jeux et à leurs artistes, que nous respectons. », beside the no-affiliation notice (spec Legal constraint, epic 7). The built per-card notice (`card_details.notice`, story 2.10) stays until the legal page exists.
- Card genre: the card shows its tome's genre; the genre list grows with specific genres only (Third-Person Shooter, Stealth, Rhythm, Shoot 'Em Up, Arcade), never Action, Adventure or Casual; a game in no tome shows no genre.
- Development database: the migrations of stories 2.10, 2.11 and 4.6 were already applied; "Rescore the cards" ran on import run 4 (no Steam call): 498 cards written, none refused, every draft card with a genre (the five new genres in use). The re-timed degraded import is no longer needed. The next deploy still runs the 4.6 check validation on its database (`bin/docker-entrypoint` runs `db:prepare`).
- A new player cannot take the daily bonus before opening a pack: their ten starting packs fill the reserve (AD-7, story 8.4); confirmed by the author.
- Development's published season 1 numbered with `catalog:number_seasons` (story 8.3).
- An older browser opening a shared card sees a line asking to update the browser instead of the invitation to sign in (author; story 10.3).
- The library's pages stay open to any browser, as the profile and card pages (story 4.7); confirmed by the author.
- The booster's revealed cards do not link to their detail (author).
- The card detail shows any card's rarity, owned or not: rarity is public catalogue information (author).
- The 25 tome genres confirmed as listed in `Steam::GenreTags` (author); folding neighbours stays open above.
- The architecture spine absorbed the redesign (AD-1 to AD-28, final); epics 8 and 10 rework the built screens, card backs (CAP-20) have epic 9 and presence (CAP-21) joins epic 5.

## Staging and production (2026-10-06)

- **Production later.** Fill `config/deploy.production.yml` (VPS address, registry such as ghcr.io), create `.kamal/secrets.production` with its own keys, point gameble.com at the VPS (Cloudflare in Full mode if used), then `bin/kamal deploy -d production`.
- Staging deployed and the first full real import run there (2026-10-06, 55 min, 12,307 cards); season 1 published on staging with the starting calibration (epic 2 Notes).

## Settled on 2026-10-06

- Staging (gameble.dotsncircles.com) deployed by the author with the Traefik route fixed; the first full real import ran there and season 1 was published (epic 2 Notes). Epic 2 marked done.
- On staging's fresh database, `db:prepare` applied every migration at boot (dust_tier dropped, numbers column, player states), season 1 was numbered by its own publication, and players get their `game_player_states` row at sign-up: the backfills `catalog:number_seasons` and `game:backfill_player_states` are not needed there. They stay available for any older database.
- Prestige formula: log10(review count) + 4 × Wilson (story 2.12); season 1 on staging keeps the old scores and is not republished.
- Pixel-art sheet of story 8.8 reviewed and approved by the author (82 files); story 8.8 marked done.
- Capability numbering confirmed by the author: CAP-19 repost (epic 6), CAP-20 card backs (epic 9), CAP-21 friends' presence (epic 5).
- Repost (CAP-19) and the feed's Friends tab (CAP-13) added to DESIGN.md and EXPERIENCE.md by the author through bmad-ux: REPOSTER on the card detail, at the end of an opening and on the hub showcase; TOUS / AMIS tabs combined with the type filters plus REPOSTS; reposts in the feed only, never in the ticker; invitation to add friends, sign-in panel when signed out.
- Folding neighbouring genres becomes a back-office tool (epic-season-preparation, story 2): after an import, the author classifies every tag (merge into a genre, own genre, ignored), English name by default with editable French and English labels, publishing refused while a tag is unclassified; needed before the next season's import.
- Import staging with rollback and genre curation grouped in a new epic, epic-season-preparation (id 11), to incept before the next season's import.
- Story 2.11's edge-case rules: kept by the author — malformed review percent excluded (`malformed_reviews`), an app listed twice in a page kept once and reported, a pass writing no card empties the draft; the rules on abandoning runs, rescoring the previous run and refusing publication after a failure are left to epic-season-preparation, whose staging-with-rollback replaces them.
